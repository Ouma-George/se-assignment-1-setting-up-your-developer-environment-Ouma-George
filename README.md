Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. **Select Your Operating System (OS):**
I have chosen to install Windows 11. 
Edition	Windows 11 Pro
Version	23H2
Installed on 2024/14/4
OS build	22631.3737
Experience	Windows Feature Experience Pack 1000.22700.1009.0

Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

The below are the specification of my Visual Studio Code
Version: 1.90.1 (user setup)
Commit: 611f9bfce64f25108829dd295f54a6894e87339d
Date: 2024-06-11T21:01:24.262Z
Electron: 29.4.0
ElectronBuildId: 9593362
Chromium: 122.0.6261.156
Node.js: 20.9.0
V8: 12.2.281.27-electron.0
OS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.22631


3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

   I have downloaded Git, configured to using: git config --global user.name  and "Ouma-George"
                                               git config --global user.email  and "georgeouma90@gmail.com"
I have created 6 repositories, committed and pushed files to them. For instane the PLP First assignment for May cohort.

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

  Since it is a python project, i have installed Python through Anaconda {i also use it for some data science lessons} I am currenlty on a rapid tech skills with a different organization where I am studying data science using Python; Software Enginnering using Javascript,HTML and CSS and Cyber Security.
  I have an understanding of Python as a programming language, HTML as a markup language and CSS as a style sheet language. I am yet to understand Dart and Flutter which I have installed too.


5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

   pip --version
pip 24.0 from C:\Python312\Lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.12)
npm (Node Package Manager) which assist to install and manage JavaScript packages noth locally or globally.


6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
MySQL Community Server 8.0.37 downloaded, MySQL Workbench 8.0.37 downloaded and installed.

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

   All programming languages for the project downloaded and installed, Version controls like Git and GitHub installed. Computer compatility check done. Database qwery systems like MySQL installed. Dart and Flutter installed.
   Docker version: 19.03.8 and and Virtual Machine version : 17.0.0

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

   Extensions such as Gitlens and Visual Studio Code Insiders, and plugins such as ESLint and Prettier downlaoded from the visual studio code marketplace.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

    

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
